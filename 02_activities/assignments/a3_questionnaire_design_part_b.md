# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

   
Using a Simple Random Sampling (SRS) strategy ensures that each entry- and lower-level employee has an equal chance of being selected, which enhances the representativeness of your sample. This method minimizes selection bias and increases the likelihood that the sample accurately reflects the target population. However, there are still potential challenges: Response Bias, Non-Response Bias, Survey Fatigue.

Representativeness of the Sample
Yes, I expect it to be representative of target population as the SRS method and assuming a high response rate, the sample is expected to be representative of the target population. Meanwhile SRS mitigates many common biases by ensuring every individual has an equal probability of selection. The representativeness also depends on achieving a high response rate and ensuring the questions are clear and unbiased.

At the same time using a stratified sampling strategy involves dividing the target population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. Stratified sampling can improve the representativeness of the sample by ensuring that all subgroups are adequately represented. This method provides more comprehensive understanding of the issues across the entire population, as well as increases precision, reduces variability and provides better insights by analysis within each subgroup, identifying specific issues that may not be apparent in the overall sample. However here can be some challenges as complexity compare to SRS and time comsuming and statum identification 

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

   After the lecture I would like to do some changes in my questions 3, 4, 6, 7  and be more specific and avoid any kind of misreading and misunderstanding. I also remove open questions by providing select points which are applicable, it will make the process of analysis more time consuming. 

- On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with your experience working at our company?
-  How happy are you with your current role? (Scale of 1-5)
- What aspects of your job do you find most challenging or unsatisfactory? (Select the most applicable )
-  What specific changes would you recommend to improve your job satisfaction? (Select all what  are applicable )
-  On a scale of 1 to 5, how aware are you of opportunities for growth and development within the company?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with your work-life balance here?
- Have you had a discussion with your manager or supervisor about your growth opportunities within the past six months? (Yes/No)
-  Do you feel recognized and appreciated for your contributions to the team? (Yes/No)
-  Do you believe that your ideas and feedback are valued by your managers? (Yes/No)
-  On a scale of 1 to 5, how likely are you to recommend our company as a place to work to a friend or colleague?

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    No, the purpose of my survey could not be fully fulfilled through an observational study. Observational studies are useful for identifying patterns and correlations but may not effectively capture the subjective experiences and specific reasons behind employee dissatisfaction and turnover.  On the other hand, they  allow discover  suggestions for improvement. write your answer here...
