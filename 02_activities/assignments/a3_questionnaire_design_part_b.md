# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    ### Comment on the Quality of Your Sample
Using a Simple Random Sampling (SRS) strategy ensures that each entry- and lower-level employee has an equal chance of being selected, which enhances the representativeness of your sample. This method minimizes selection bias and increases the likelihood that the sample accurately reflects the target population. However, there are still potential challenges: Response Bias, Non-Response Bias, and Survey Fatigue.

Representativeness of the Sample
Yes, I expect it to be representative of the target population. As the SRS method and assuming a high response rate, the sample is expected to be representative of the target population. SRS mitigates many common biases by ensuring every individual has an equal probability of selection. The representativeness also depends on achieving a high response rate and ensuring the questions are clear and unbiased.

At the same time, using a stratified sampling strategy involves dividing the target population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. Stratified sampling can improve the representativeness of the sample by ensuring that all subgroups are adequately represented. This method provides a more comprehensive understanding of the issues across the entire population, as well as increases precision, reduces variability, and provides better insights by analyzing within each subgroup, identifying specific issues that may not be apparent in the overall sample. However, there can be some challenges, such as complexity compared to SRS, being time-consuming, and stratum identification.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric
